                  I am looking for a bright and motivated student to reserach and develop a new wearable technology for continuous and non-invasive biofluid analysis. Prospective PhD students can apply for a fully-funded PhD postion covering 3.5 years of full stipend and tuition fees (at UK rate). 
                  More details and online application available <a href=https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/feasibility-of-wireless-and-wearable-technology-for-continuous-measurement-of-biomolecules-in-biofluids/?p152554 target="_blank"> here </a>. 
                  Feel free to email me directly if you would like to submit an application for this post. <br> <br>
                  
                  I am always looking for high-calibre reserachers to join my team for PhD or postdoctoral reserach on analogue IC design, electrochemical nano/biosensors, and lab-on-CMOS.<br>
  
  If you are interested in joing my team for your PhD studies please get in touch via email, attaching both your CV and transcripts.
                  Please note that due to the large number of emails I receive, I may not respond to those with no CV/transcripts attached or where no refrenece is made to the financial requirements of the candidate. 
                  You may find the list of <a href=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder target="_blank"> scholarships </a> available at UCL to find the one you might be eligible to apply for. Other funded PhD positions can be found on the <a href=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/epsrc-doctoral-training/prospective-students/apply-ucl-epsrc-dtp-studentship target="_blank"> UCL EPSRC DTP </a> page <br> <br>
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
                Any funded postdoctoral reserach positions will be announced here as soon as they become available. 
                If you would like to apply for a postdoctoral "fellowship" (e.g. RAEng, Marie Curie, EPSRC postdoctoral fellowships) to join my team, please email me directly and attach your CV, a one-paragraph desription of the reserach topic you suggest for the fellowship, and how the topic matches the current reserach in my team. 
  Due to the large number of emails I receive, I may not respond to those with no clear description of how the prposed topic is related to creserach in my team <br> <br>
