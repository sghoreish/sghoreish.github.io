                  I am looking for a bright and motivated student to reserach and develop a new wearable technology for continuous and non-invasive biofluid analysis. Prospective PhD students can apply for a fully-funded PhD postion covering 3.5 years of full stipend and tuition fees (at UK rate). 
                  More details and online application available <a href=https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/feasibility-of-wireless-and-wearable-technology-for-continuous-measurement-of-biomolecules-in-biofluids/?p152554 target="_blank"> here </a>. 
                  Feel free to email me directly if you would like to submit an application for this post. <br> <br>
                  
                  If you are interested in joing the team as a PhD student in a topic different from the above, such as in microelectronics design, biosensors, and lab-on-CMOS, you are welcome get in touch via email, attaching your CV and transcripts.
                  Please note that due to the large number of emails I receive, I may not respond to those with no CV/transcripts attached or where no refrenece is made to the financial needs/requirements of the candidate. 
                  You may find the list of <a href=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scholarships/scholarships-finder target="_blank"> scholarships </a> available at UCL to find the one you might be eligible to apply for. <br> <br>
                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                              
                Any funded postdoctoral reserach positions will be announced here as soon as they become available. 
                If you would like to apply for a postdoctoral fellowship to join the team, please email me directly and attach your CV, a brief desription of the topic you suggest and how it matches the current reserach in our team. <br> <br>
